title: Prediction Using Random Forest in R
---

#### Random Forest 

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of over fitting to their training set. Random forests generally outperform decision trees, but their accuracy is lower than gradient boosted trees. However, data characteristics can affect their performance.Random forests can be used to rank the importance of variables in a regression or classification problem in a natural way.


#### Project Details

The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

Content:
The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, "Outcome". Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.This is a categorical dataset.
